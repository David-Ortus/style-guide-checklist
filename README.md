## Style Audit
To understand where we need to go and how we are going to get there, we need to
understand what the current reality is

1. Audit the existing styles for each separate front-end codebase
  - Find intersections of common styles
  - Visualize and compare how values relate to eachother
2. Collect prior print collateral: letterhead, marketing etc. 
3. Collect email screenshots
4. Visualize flows for common patterns
- [ ] Log in
- [ ] Sign up
- [ ] Delete account
- [ ] Lost password reset
- [ ] Change email
- [ ] Change credit card
- [ ] Change address


## Pages 
Common pages. Some of these might be more appropriate as sections 
on a page depending on your particular content.

- [ ] Home 
- [ ] About
- [ ] Contact
- [ ] Help

### Error pages
- [ ] 404
- [ ] 500
- [ ] 503


## Consuming the styleguide

- Who is the audience?
- What are their biggest needs?
- What needs do they not have that we are assuming they have?
- Onboarding a new designer. What is their process? How can we structure the
  styleguide in a way that reduces friction and unknowns for a new teammate or
  person that is collaborating with us?
- Video tutorials
- Written guides and visual examples
- Resources?
