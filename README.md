## Style Audit
To understand where we need to go and how we are going to get there, we need to
understand what the current reality is


1. Audit the existing styles for each separate front-end codebase
  - Find intersections of common styles
  - Visualize and compare how values relate to eachother
2. Collect prior print collateral: letterhead, marketing etc. 
3. Collect email screenshots
4. Visualize flows for common patterns
  - Log in
  - Sign up
  - Delete account
  - Lost password reset
  - Change email
  - Change credit card
  - Change address

#### Consuming the styleguide

- Who are all of the people who will consume this?
- What are their biggest needs?
- What needs do they not have that we are assuming they have?
- Onboarding a new designer. What is their process? How can we structure
the styleguide in a way that reduces friction and unknowns for a new teammate or someone collaborating with us?
- Video tutorials
- Written guides and visual examples
